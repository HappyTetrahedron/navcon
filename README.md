# TSN Stellar Navigation Console

This is not-a-fork of https://github.com/tsnrp/navcon -- it's the same code base, but it was manually modified several times, and I have no idea how it is related to that git repository, since the git history of the copy I used here was lost long ago. 
It can therefore be considered an independent project, although it shares a lot of code.

This particular repository houses version 14.0 and onwards, maintained by Tetra as of 2023.

This project is in maintenance mode - it will be sunset with the adoption of Artemis Cosmos in the TSN Community, so there is now no point in creating new features and big improvements. We will however fix bugs and issues where we find them.
