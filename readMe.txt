This is the root folder for the TSN Stellar Navigation Console

Documentation: How It Works / How To Make Changes 

The Nav Console displays a Systems menu item for every subfolder under the Nav/sectors folder and displays 
Each sector folder contains 
1) sector.txt defining which gate network, the number of sectors across and down in the defined system (The sectors folder should really be named systems.)
2) a png image file of each sector in the system. Each is named with the the sequential number defining its position in the sector starting top left and proceeding across and down.
3) entities.txt listing all stations and other objects on the map.
- Each line lists the name, type, sector-map-number and an optional classified tag defining the object
- Each line is parsed and displayed by Nav/sectorEntities.php. This should be updated for new entity types e.g. Planet
4) mainMapPos.txt defining the number of pixels in from the left and down from the top of the graphic in the img/gateNetwork.png overview map
   index.php uses it to locate the clickzones to navigate from the network map to a sector

How to have Classified only versions of files

If the user is logged onto the classified version then all files will be preferentially loaded from the classified directory first.
For example the file sectors/Atlantis/1.png would first try to load classified/sectors/Atlantis/1.png
This can be used to have different versions for the classified and unclassified versions of file.
entities.txt has a special inline version of classification to make it easier to manage
If all the files are classified the system wont appear on the main system menu for the unclassified systems, thus making it hidden from those users.
